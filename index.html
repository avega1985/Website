      My name is Andres Vega, and although I only began pursuing writing and design very recently, I have quickly grown passionate about both. I have a lot more writing experience, as I was originally a Writing major with the goal of being a football journalist before transitioning to DNID. As a writer, my style tends to lean on vivid imagery and colorful language to captivate readers. Writing, particularly in the realm of sports analysis and commentary, is one of my biggest interests. One of my key inspirations is creating accessible and engaging content that allows fans to develop a deeper understanding of the sports they love. Due to the deeper intricacies of football, I want to be able to take complex ideas and present them in clear, digestible ways, making the more complicated parts of football both enjoyable and approachable to a broader audience. When it comes to design, while my experiences have been more limited and heavily structured, I have gained a bigger understanding of design and the style that I want my work to take. However, while I am still in the process of discovering my design aesthetic, I am eager to merge my writing and design skills more cohesively in future endeavors to create visually compelling work. I believe incorporating design with my writing will allow me to achieve my goals better as design can help elevate and make writing more accessible and easier to understand. My ultimate goal is to produce writing-design projects that inform and engage audiences, especially in the football media landscape, by blending thoughtful analysis with strong visual design through the medium of statistics and data.
