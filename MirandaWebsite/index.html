My mom showed me a video of a pas de deux and I instantly knew that that was going to be me one day. I started and still am at Metropolitan Ballet Academy and Company. Now I’m 17 with 12 years of experience and hoping to dance professionally real soon. While at Metropolitan I’ve had the opportunity to perform in many different ballets as well as work with many choreographers such as Ashely Pabst, Doane Da’von, Tommie Waheed, and Kanji Segawa. I’ve performed as Cupid in Don Quixote, Romantic girl in Graduation Ball, Gretel in Hansel and Gretel, Ugly Duckling in Ugly Ducking, Cinderella in Cinderella; as well as Party Girl and Pollichinelle in 2020 and Candy Cane in 2024 in Philadelphia Ballet’s Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker. Ballet has formed me into the person that I am today a hard worker who’s disciplined and always ready to learn.      </p>
